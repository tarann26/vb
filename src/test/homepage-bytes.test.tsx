// Pinned by hand in four separate plan reviews and enforced by nothing
// until now. Measured with `TextEncoder`, not `.length`: the rendered page
// contains U+00A0 (non-breaking space) and `é`, both of which are one JS
// UTF-16 code unit but more than one UTF-8 byte, so `.length` reads 53454 --
// a different number that is not the invariant this test exists to guard.
//
// Every task in the worker plan runs this. A change here is either a real,
// deliberate edit to the public homepage (state the old and new numbers and
// what accounts for the difference, in the same commit) or a regression --
// this test cannot tell those apart, which is the point: it forces the
// distinction to be made explicitly rather than silently.
//
// Plan 6, Task 2, Step 3: 53473 -> 53485 (+12 bytes). `galleries.json`'s
// entry 4 gained an explicit `row-start-1` -- twelve ASCII characters,
// including the leading space Hero.tsx's own template-literal join adds
// (`` `${className} relative overflow-hidden` ``) -- so it stops
// auto-placing into an implicit seventh row, where `Hero.tsx:57`'s
// `overflow-hidden` hid it. This is the one task in this plan that is
// EXPECTED to move this number: `className` is rendered into the DOM
// verbatim regardless of whether Tailwind has a matching CSS rule for it,
// so this invariant cannot see -- and is not the guard for -- the CSS
// repair itself (Task 2's own rule-level stylesheet diff is).
//
// Plan 6, Task 4, Step 1: 53485 -> 53773 (+288 bytes). Hero.tsx now passes
// `draggable={false}` on every one of the sixteen collage `<img>`s (Task 4's
// own requirement -- native HTML5 image drag hijacks the pointer sequence a
// real drag-to-move needs on desktop, and CollageTile.tsx cannot set this
// itself: it receives the image already rendered, as an opaque child).
// React renders `draggable` as an explicit `draggable="false"` attribute,
// never omitted the way a plain boolean HTML attribute would be for
// `false` -- eighteen bytes (`" draggable=\"false\""`) times sixteen tiles
// is the whole difference. Harmless on the public page: nothing there ever
// depended on a collage photo being natively draggable.
